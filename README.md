This project analyzes the drivers of retail store sales using a structured approach. It begins with selecting business-relevant variables and performing summary statistics to understand them through metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation. A correlation matrix is used to pick variables for the model while checking for multicollinearity issues. The data is split into training and test sets with an 80/20 split to ensure an unbiased model assessment. A multilinear regression model is then created, with a constant added to the X group. Key metrics are evaluated to determine the model's effectiveness in predicting sales drivers, providing valuable insights for business analysis.
